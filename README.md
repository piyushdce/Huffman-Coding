# Huffman-Coding
Huffman Coding is used to compress files by assigning smaller codes to characters which occur frequently in a file.
In this project Huffman coding is used to implement file compression using C programming. 
The Input file is read to get the frequency of each character and based on that a coding tree is generated 
where characters with higher frequency are assigned a smaller code than characters with lower frequency. 
The compression algorithm is tested on input file having text and non-text data ranging from few bytes to several Megabytes. 
It is observed that on average Huffman coding is able to achieve 38% compression rate.
